I can type notes
- [ ] I can make a to do list
- [x] and check the items off


Or ordered lists:
1. Type here
  1. indent here
  1. again
1. Shit+Tab worked to unindent.
- Wonder what happens here
- Just a list
- Here's some code

```ruby
#I can even write code blocks like this:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
num = 3

puts arr.include?(num)
```
- Here's a list after that.
