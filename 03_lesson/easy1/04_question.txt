Question 4

The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)

Both methods mutate the array.
#delete_at is referring to the first index of the array.
#delete is referring to an object with the value of 1.
