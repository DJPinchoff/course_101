inputs:
-From user gets
  -loan amount = p
  -APR = a
  -loan duration in years = d

outputs:
-Calculate
  -monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
  -loan duration in months = d * 12 = n
  
-Print to User
  -Monthly Payment:
    m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
    p = loan amount
    j = monthly interest rate = APR / 12
    n = loan duration in months
    
  -Total cost of loan:
    m * loan duration in months

-Example/Test Cases:
  -$20,000 @ 3% APR, 5 years = $359, $21,562
  -$100,000 & 4.2% APR, 15 years = $750, $134,955

Data Structures:
-I think we can just use clearly defined variables.
  -Floats rounded to two decimal digits

Algorithm:
  -Get inputs from user - loop if input is not valid
  -Calculate needed variables
  -Print out answers
  
START
  PRINT "Welcome to your Mortgage/Car Loan Payment Calculator!"
  PRINT "Let's calculate your monthly payment and total cost..."
  PRINT "Enter the loan amount you want to take:"
  
  GET input from user.to_f
    -READ input and check to see if it is a valid number
  IF valid number
    SET p to loan amount
  ELSE
    GET input and check it again.
  
  Same steps as GET, IF SET, ELSE
    APR = a
    yearly loan duration = d
  
  SET monthly_interest_rate = j = a / 12
  SET loan_duration_in_months = n = d * 12
  # Remember p is loan amount
  SET m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
  PRINT "Your monthly loan payment is $#{m}. And your total cost is $#{m * n}."
