A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

INFORMAL PSEUDO CODE:

-Define a method called every_other(int_array)
  -Create an empty answer_array 
  -Iterate through each_index of int_array
    -Check to see if the index is even (0, 2, 4)
    -If it is even, then push the element at that index to answer_array
  -After iteration, return answer_array 
  
  FORMAL PSEUDO CODE:
  
  START
  
  Given a method definition for every_other(int_array)
    SET answer_array = []
    READ each_index of int_array
      IF index.even? then push int_array[index] to answer_array
    PRINT answer_array
  END
